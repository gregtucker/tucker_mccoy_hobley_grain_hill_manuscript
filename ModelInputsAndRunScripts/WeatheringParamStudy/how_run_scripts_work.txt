How the Grain Hill Dakota runs work
May 2017

Start by modifying the file launch_gh_dakota_local.sh or launch_gh_dakota_beach.sh, or
whatever else is the appropriate launch script:

o set the SOURCEDIR variable to be the directory in which your source files live
o set the RUNDIR variable to be the directory in which you want Dakota to run (this is
also the directory in which Dakota will make run.1, run.2, etc., subdirectories)

In the file grain_hill_run_config.py, set the source path (i.e., the directory containing
the model files) and the "jobsub" option, which should be "None" (for local), or "qsub"
(for beach).

Run:

./launch_gh_dakota_<option>.sh

What happens:

o launch_gh_dakota_<option>.sh copies some files and starts Dakota

o Dakota picks parameter values for a run, then calls the analysis driver
  grain_hill_dakota_run_driver.py
  
o grain_hill_dakota_run_driver.py reads from grain_hill_run_config.py, which is the file
  one needs to modify to set whether this is local or HPCC, and set source folder.

o IF this is a local run:
  - calls run_grain_hill_local.sh, sending it the source path
  - run_grain_hill_local calls dakota_friendly_driver.py
  - dakota_friendly_driver reads the parameter input file inputs.txt, instantiates a
    GrainHill model, runs it, analyzes its maximum elevation and mean slope, and writes
    these to file results.out.

  ELSE if this is on beach:
  - makes a unique name for this job
  - calls qsub to submit run_grain_hill_beach.sh
  - writes a results.out file with dummy values, which leads dakota to advance to the next
    run
