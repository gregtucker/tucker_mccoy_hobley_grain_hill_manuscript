# grain_hills

This repository includes:

1) Source code for Grain Hill model

2) Files and figures in submitted manuscript describing the model

3) Input files and run scripts for model runs in the paper

The two series of 5x5x5 parameter study runs were conducted on
the Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System [CSDMS] Beach 
supercomputer, and the scripts to implement those runs in parallel
are somewhat involved.

I haven't meticulously gone through and removed temporary exploratory
files that are no longer needed, so caveat mutator.
